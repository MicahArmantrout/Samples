This project builds on HelloWorld by introducing models and a second view on a single controller.

NOTES:

To add a model, simply add a class to the Models folder.

To add a view:
1.  Add a folder under Views and give it the same name as the controller
2.  Right click on the folder and choose Add -> View
     Make sure you check the box for "Create a strongly-typed view" and enter the name
	 of the model class you want to use.
     Turn off all other options
